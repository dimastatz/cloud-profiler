# Expert System for Software Profiling

## Background
Profiling is a dynamic code analysis. Profilers capture characteristics of the application as it runs, and then developers use this information to make applications faster and more efficient. For example, one of the most known JVM profilers is [JProfiler](https://www.ej-technologies.com/resources/jprofiler/help/doc/JProfiler.pdf). JProfiler collects the following data: methods calls data (aka CPU profiling), allocations (heap allocations, GC), threads and locks and data from higher level subsystems like JDBC, HTTP, etc. All collected data is shown in JProfiler's UI. By examining data on Jprofiler UI, developers can figure out if there any problem in the profiled application and hopefully find a root cause for it. 
However, it is really hard to make sense of profilers output. One should be an expert in Java programming language in order to make sense of data that it shown on JProfiler UI.
