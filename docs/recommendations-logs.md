# Recommendation for Java logging

## Background
Logging runtime information in software applications is useful for understanding the behavior of any app. Log files can save a lot of time by providing clues into the cause of the problem, and into the state of the system at the time it happened. Also, logging can be useful for auditing purposes, gathering statistics, extracting business intelligence and a variety of other tasks. 
However, logging can be a source of performance problems. The document provides a software design for the expert system that helps developers to understand the root cause of performance problems that can occur in Java Logging Frameworks.
